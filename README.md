# IpTracker-Go
Small app checks your current external IP and puts it in dropbox

**Usage**

* Build it
* Create a dropbox app and a token at the dropbox app console here https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/
* Set it up in cron to run as often as you like
* Check dropbox when that pesky ISP changes your IP for no particular reason
